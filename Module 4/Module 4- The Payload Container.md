# Module 4: The Payload Container

Now that you've successfully prepared the mount, let's get ready prepare the container itself. 

Module 3 will FILL IN THE REST

## Will our payload container protect the computer from the conditions in near space?

(The FOLLOWING TEXT is from Module 2, modify)

Your balloon's telemetry unit, or as we like to call it, Space Computer, will allow you and your team to read atmospheric conditions at the very top of the earth's atmosphere. As the balloon rises, it will leave the earth below and enter a different kind of place, very different than where you are standing right now.

At about 100,000 feet, or 19 miles above the earth, interesting things start to happen. Have you ever heard of the Stratosphere? That's where we're going with our HAB. In the Stratosphere, there is very air to breath, atmospheric pressure (that which causes your ears to pop when you go up to higher altitudes) is far far lower than on earth and it's very, very cold! Also, it's where the Ozone layer exists, which protects us from harmful cosmic rays.

Do you think you could surive up in the Stratosphere without a space suit?

### Tools
The payload container is pretty easy :

* Scissors

* Ruler for measuring



## Let's get started!

### 1. We'll begin by building the telemetry mount. 
The telemetry mount acts as docking bay for your space computer. With a battery unit to keep the RPi and Grove Pi fed with power, we are ensuring that the computers and sensors will be safe and secured for flight.

For this section, you will need:
>
- 4x 2.98" screws
- 16x nuts 
- 8x Zip ties
- Spot GPS Unit
- Fully assembled Telemetry Unit
- Battery Pack
- Telemetry Mount parts A and B

###Let's get started!

##Part A

#####Step 1.
Place the velcro side of Part A downward, and line up the RPi and Grove Pi above the holes as in the photograph below. 
> (Image)

#####Step 2.
Using the smaller zip ties, strap down the RPi to the interior holes, as seen in the photos below.

#####Step 3.
Tighten the zip ties, make sure that they are firm. Once they are nice and tight, cut the excess plastic from the zip tie, but BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT ANY OTHER WIRES. See the images below. Do it for all 4 zip ties.

> (IMage of right way of doing it)

#####Step 4.

Gently turn Part A around to reveal the other sidewith a strip of velcro. While avoiding to block any of the holes in the Part A, attach the battery unit to the velcro, carefully placing it in the center.

#####Step 5.
Using the large zip ties, strap down the Battery unit to the second set of holes, as seen in the photos below.

#####Step 6.
Tighten the zip ties, make sure that they firmly secure the battery. Once they are nice and tight, cut the excess plastic from the zip tie, but BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT ANY OTHER WIRES. See the images below. Do it for all 2 zip ties.

####You're doing great! We've just finished the first part of the mount, let's continue on.

##Part B

#####Step 1.
Prepare your 2.98" screws by screwing on 4 nuts all the way to the head of the screw.

> (Image of screws with nuts)

Now, insert the 2.98" screws into the Part B of the telemetry mount. Be sure that the top end of the screw (Where you would normally insert the screwdriver) if on the side of the mount which has the Velcro.

#####Step 2.
Using 4 more nuts, tighten the screws using your fingers. Make sure they are nice and tight.

#####Step 3.

Screw in 1 nut onto each screw. Measure the distance from the base to the screw to the nut for a distance of 1.65", do this for all 4 nuts.

#####Step 4.
Time to combine Part A with Part B to form the super mega telemetry Unit.

With Part be laying with the screws facing up, line up Part A above it. Ensure that the front of the batter is facing the front of Part B (the part that looks like Batman ears)

#####Step 5.

Using the 4 remaining screws, secure Part A and B together. Tighten the screws well. 

####Awesome! We've successfuly attached the units. Let's finish it off!

##Part C

Now to secure the GPS sensor, The Spot GPS, and the Sattelite modem. 

####Let's start with the GPS Sensor

#####Step 1. 
Gently flip the unit so that the velco side of Part B is facing up.

#####Step 2. 
Carefully disconnect the GPS connector from the unit.

#####Step 3.
Pass the connector cord through the opening in Part B.

> (image of cord passing through)

#####Step 4. 

Reconnect the Cord to the GPS Unit, and then secure it onto the corresponding Velcro.

####Great! Now for the Satellite Modem

#####Step 1.
Line up the Sattelite Modem with the two holes as shown in the photo below.

> (Image of unit sitting atop of holes)

#####Step 2. 
Secure the unit by using two zip ties. Tighten the ties, and then cut them. Be very careful not to cut any of the wires surring the zipties.

####Finally, let's secure the Spot GPS

#####Step 1.
Carefully line up the Spot GPS unit with the velcro, and attach them together. Voila!

####Whoa. We're the mount! Looks awesome, doesn't it?

# Module 3: Telemetry Mount

Now that you've successfully prepared the brains of your HAB, it's time to give it a body.  

The payload contain may look like an ordinary foam box, but it has been modified to be a safe, warm shell that will protect our telemetry and GPS units from the freezing cold temperatures of the stratosphere. 

Module 3 will FILL IN THE REST

## Will our payload container protect the computer from the conditions in near space?

(The FOLLOWING TEXT is from Module 2, modify)

Your balloon's telemetry unit, or as we like to call it, Space Computer, will allow you and your team to read atmospheric conditions at the very top of the earth's atmosphere. As the balloon rises, it will leave the earth below and enter a different kind of place, very different than where you are standing right now.

At about 100,000 feet, or 19 miles above the earth, interesting things start to happen. Have you ever heard of the Stratosphere? That's where we're going with our HAB. In the Stratosphere, there is very air to breath, atmospheric pressure (that which causes your ears to pop when you go up to higher altitudes) is far far lower than on earth and it's very, very cold! Also, it's where the Ozone layer exists, which protects us from harmful cosmic rays.

Do you think you could surive up in the Stratosphere without a space suit?

### Tools
The payload container is pretty easy :

* Scissors

* Ruler for measuring



## Let's get started!

### 1. We'll begin by building the telemetry mount. 
The telemetry mount acts as docking bay for your space computer. With a battery unit to keep the RPi and Grove Pi fed with power, we are ensuring that the computers and sensors will be safe and secured for flight.

For this section, you will need:
>
- 4x 2.98" screws
- 16x nuts 
- 8x Zip ties
- Spot GPS Unit
- Fully assembled Telemetry Unit
- Battery Pack
- Telemetry Mount parts A and B

###Let's get started!

##Part A

#####Step 1.
Place the velcro side of Part A downward, and line up the RPi and Grove Pi above the holes as in the photograph below. 
> (Image)

#####Step 2.
Using the smaller zip ties, strap down the RPi to the interior holes, as seen in the photos below. 
> (image)

> (Image)

> (Image)

#####Step 3.
Tighten the zip ties, make sure that they are firm. Once they are nice and tight, cut the excess plastic from the zip tie, but BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT ANY OTHER WIRES. See the images below. Do it for all 4 zip ties.

#####Step 5.
Using the large zip ties, strap down the Battery unit to the second set of holes, as seen in the photos below. 
> (Image of placing the zip ties)

> (Image of securing them)

#####Step 6.
Tighten the zip ties, make sure that they firmly secure the battery. Once they are nice and tight, cut the excess plastic from the zip tie, but BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT ANY OTHER WIRES. See the images below. Do it for all 2 zip ties.

> (IMage of right way of doing it)

####You're doing great! We've just finished the first part of the mount, let's continue on.

##Part B

#####Step 1.
Prepare your 2.98" screws by screwing on 4 nuts all the way to the head of the screw.

> (Image of screws with nuts)

Now, insert the 2.98" screws into the Part B of the telemetry mount. Be sure that the top end of the screw (Where you would normally insert the screwdriver) if on the side of the mount which has the Velcro.

#####Step 3.

Screw in 1 nut onto each screw. Measure the distance from the base to the screw to the nut for a distance of 1.65", do this for all 4 nuts.

> (Image of the nuts measured)

#####Step 4.
Time to combine Part A with Part B to form the super mega telemetry Unit.

With Part be laying with the screws facing up, line up Part A above it. Ensure that the front of the batter is facing the front of Part B (the part that looks like Batman ears)

> (Image Part A sitting on Part A)

#####Step 5.

Using the 4 remaining screws, secure Part A and B together. Tighten the screws well. 

####Awesome! We've successfuly attached the units. Let's finish it off!

##Part C

Now to secure the GPS sensor, The Spot GPS, and the Sattelite modem. 

####Let's start with the GPS Sensor

#####Step 1. 
Gently flip the unit so that the velco side of Part B is facing up.

### 2. Starting at the HomeScreen
> (Image of Homescreen)

1. From your Raspberry Pi Homescreen, click on the Modules folder, then Module 2.md

> (Small Image of icon)


### 3. Let's build this thing!

We're going to now build the unit.

### A) GPS

a.1) Connect the GPS unit to its antenna 
> (Image)

a.2) Connect the GPS unit to the Grove Pi (Connector A2)
> (Image of the RPi connecting to GPS)


### that was it! Now let's see if it worked)  

a.3) Go to your desktop and double click on the TEST icon. This will run your code in a terminal window, which activates the GPS, giving us the GPS unit's location in the form of degrees of latitude, longitude, and altitude measured in feet, as well as the cardinal direction.  

See the image below for an example of what it should look like.

![MacDown logo](placeholder-400x350.png)

### What if it didn't work?

Try the following
>
1. Make sure your RPi is plugged in and the lights are on.
2. Ensure that the GPS Antenna (the black thing) has nothing blocking it from the sky. Try putting it next to a window, that oughta do it.
3. Check to see if the GPS unit is plugged into the right port on the Grove Pi (A2). 
4. If you're still having trouble, see your instructor for some help.

#####If it worked, you can close the 'TEST' terminal and move on to the next step.

###B) Temperature Sensor
b.1) Plug in the Temperature Sensor Unit into the Grove Pi (Connector D7)
> (Image of Temp Sensor being plugged in)

b.2) Now we've got to prepare the code. We're going copy the following code into your forge, under the Temperature Sensor Tab. 

Step 1. Highlight and then copy this text.
```
Enter the code for the temp sensor here
```

Step 2. Open up your forge from the desktop if you do not already have it open.

Step 3. Click on the Temperature Sensor tab in the Forge
> (image of the Temperature sensor Tab)

Step 4. Paste the code 
> (image showing code pasted under Temperature Sensor Tab)

###Great! Now we're going to test our code to see if the Temperature Sensor is telling us how hot or cold it is

b.3) Just like we did when testing the GPS unit, go to your desktop and double click the 'TEST' icon. The code will run in a terminal window, and will look like what we see in the image below. 

*** Note that if the GPS coordinates are not working, it may be because the antenna does not have a direct line of site to the sky. It's okay, we don't need to worry about it at this point. Onward!

### What if it didn't work?

Try the following
>
1. Make sure your RPi is plugged in and the lights are on.
2. Ensure that the Temperature Sensor is plugged into the right port on the Grove Pi (Connector D7). 
3. Make sure that the code was copied and pasted in the Temperature Sensor Tab, and that there aren't any additional characters that might have been typed in by accident. If you aren't sure, delete all the code in the tab, and re-paste it from this document again.
4. If you're still having trouble, see your instructor for some help.

#####If it worked, you can close the 'TEST' terminal and move on to the next step.

###C) Sound Sensor
c.1) Plug in the Sound Sensor Unit into the Grove Pi (Connector A0)
> (Image of Sound Sensor being plugged in)

b.2) Now we've got to prepare the code. We're going copy the following code into your forge, under the Sound Sensor Tab. 

Step 1. Highlight and then copy this text.
```
Enter the code for the sound sensor here
```

Step 2. Open up your forge from the desktop if you do not already have it open.

Step 3. Click on the Sound Sensor tab in the Forge
> (image of the Sound sensor Tab)

Step 4. Paste the code 
> (image showing code pasted under Sound Sensor Tab)

###Great! Now we're going to test our code to see if the Sound Sensor is picking up noises

c.3) Run the 'Test' Icon from your desktop. This will run the code in a terminal window, and it will show the relative volume of sound occuring around the Sound Sensor. 

####A more fun way to test:
>Try clapping your hands loudly near the sensor, or talking loudly around it. Note how the data changes based off of the volume that it reads. Now try to get the room as quiet as possible. See the difference? 

### What if it didn't work?

Try the following
>
1. Make sure your RPi is plugged in and the lights are on.
2. Ensure that the Sound Sensor is plugged into the right port on the Grove Pi (Connector A0). 
3. Make sure that the code was copied and pasted in the Sound Sensor Tab, and that there aren't any additional characters that might have been typed in by accident. If you aren't sure, delete all the code in the tab, and re-paste it from this document again.
4. If you're still having trouble, see your instructor for some help.


###D) LCD RGB Display
d.1) Plug in the Display Sensor Unit into the Grove Pi (Connector I2C-2)
> (Image of Sound Sensor being plugged in to I2C-2)

d.2) Now we've got to prepare the code, but this time, you're going to type the code manually! The image below contains the exact code to make the Display work - it's your job to type it in and to make it work. Here's how:

Step 1. Open up your forge from the desktop if you do not already have it open.

Step 2. Click on the RGB LCD Display Sensor tab in the Forge
> (image of the RGB LCD Display sensor Tab)

Step 3. Type in the code in the image right below into the RGB LCD Display sensor tab.
> (image showing code for RGB LCD Display Sensor)

Step 4. This is what it will look like when you're done
> (image of the code in the RGB LCD Display Sensor Tab)

###Excellent work. Now we're going to test to see if the code will active the Dipslay

d.3) Run the 'Test' Icon from your desktop. This will run the code in a terminal window, and will active the Display showing the text 'Hello World'.

####What else can we show on this display?
Instead of just saying Hello World, we're going to have this display show us temperature data that the Temperature Sensor is providing. 

####Here's how:

> Step 1. Close your 'Test' terminal, then go back to your Forge and click on the RGB LCD Display tab.

> Step 2. From within this tab, locate line #5, and alter the following code from:

> ```
> message = “Hello World:” 
> ```
> 
Step 3. to this:

> ```
> message = “temp (C):” + temperatureData
> ```

### What if it didn't work?

Try the following
>
1. Make sure your RPi is plugged in and the lights are on.
2. Ensure that the RGB LCD Display Sensor is plugged into the right port on the Grove Pi (Connector I2C-2). 
3. Make sure that the code was typed in exactly as shown in the image above within the  in the RGBLCD Dipsplay Sensor Tab, and that there aren't any additional characters that might have been typed in by accident. If you aren't sure, delete all the code in the tab, and re-type it and follow the steps over again.
4. If you're still having trouble, see your instructor for some help.
